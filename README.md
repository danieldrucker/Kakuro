Kakuro

Japanese Logic Game



---------------

This is a game of the Japanese logic puzzle called KAKURO that I programmed just for fun. I saw the app on itunes, found it challenging so I decided to give it a try. I only put one board in, but hopefully someday I will put in more! (Or write an algorithm that does it for me.) I put in a couple cool features such as solve row/ column and show notes, which are featured in the app. Show notes was probably the toughest because I had to find out all logically possible numbers that could go in a given slot.

Kakuro is like a crossword puzzle with numbers. Each "word" must add up to the number provided in the clue above it or to the left. Words can only use the numbers 1 through 9, and a given number can only be used once in a word. Every kakuro puzzle has one and only solution, and can be solved through logic alone.
